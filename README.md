I am a tech enthusiast and experienced artist with a passion for problem-solving through innovation. As a sculptor, I've learned to create value from nothing — a skill I seamlessly translate into the digital landscape. In my world, technology is more than a tool, it's a medium for creation. I approach coding as an art form, sculpting applications that not only function but also impress and leave a lasting impact. Precision meets passion as I leverage my artistic perspective to build applications that stand out. I'm driven by my constant curiosity, always ready to embrace new technologies and innovative solutions. Growth and learning is a continuous journey for me, from mastering programming languages, staying ahead in dynamic industries to discovering new ways for my artistic expressions.
Beyond the screen and my art studio, I find inspiration in nature. A yogi for decades, I bring a holistic approach to my work, ensuring balance and harmony in every project. It's a philosophy that builds my soft skills, that reflects in both my code and my connection with the natural world.
I'm not a typical coder—I'm also an exhibited and awarded sculptor. Whether shaping tangible forms or lines of code, my goal is consistent: to create value where it didn't exist before. Problem-solving isn't just a task, it's an opportunity to innovate.
Join me on a journey where art and technology converge. Together, we can build applications that go beyond the ordinary. Eager to tackle new challenges and bring fresh perspectives, I'm a coder and I'm an artist shaping the future, one line of code at a time.
